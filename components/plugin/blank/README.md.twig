# {{ component_title }} Plugin

**This README.md file should be modified to describe the features, installation, configuration, and general usage of the plugin.**

The **{{ component_title }}** Plugin is an extension for [Grav CMS](https://github.com/getgrav/grav). {{ component.description }}

## Installation

Installing the {{ component_title }} plugin can be done in one of three ways: The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method lets you quickly install the plugin with a simple terminal command, the manual method lets you do so via a zip file, and the admin method lets you do so via the Admin Plugin.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

To install the plugin via the [GPM](https://learn.getgrav.org/cli-console/grav-cli-gpm), through your system's terminal (also called the command line), navigate to the root of your Grav-installation, and enter:

    bin/gpm install {{ component_hyphenated }}

This will install the {{ component_title }} plugin into your `/user/plugins`-directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/{{ component_hyphenated }}`.

### Manual Installation

To install the plugin manually, download the zip-version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then rename the folder to `{{ component_hyphenated }}`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ developer_hyphenated }}/grav-plugin-{{ component_hyphenated }}) or via [GetGrav.org](https://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/{{ component_hyphenated }}
	
> NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which may require other plugins to operate, please see its [blueprints.yaml-file on GitHub](https://github.com/{{ developer_hyphenated }}/grav-plugin-{{ component_hyphenated }}/blob/main/blueprints.yaml).

### Admin Plugin

If you use the Admin Plugin, you can install the plugin directly by browsing the `Plugins`-menu and clicking on the `Add` button.

## Configuration

Before configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/{{ component_hyphenated }}/{{ component_hyphenated }}.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/{{ component_hyphenated }}.yaml` and only edit that copy.

Here is the default configuration and an explanation of available options:

```yaml
enabled: true
```

Note that if you use the Admin Plugin, a file with your configuration named {{component_hyphenated}}.yaml will be saved in the `user/config/plugins/`-folder once the configuration is saved in the Admin.
